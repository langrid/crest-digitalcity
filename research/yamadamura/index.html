<h3>Visualization of environment in Yamada Village, Toyama</h3>

<div class="text">
<p>The present situation in Yamada Village, Toyama, is as follows: 1) There are many elderly people. 2) Most are farmers. 3) The households are widely separated. 4) They do not farm efficiently, because they have a poor understanding of the environment in their village.  5) They are not sufficiently aware of the need to conserve nature.  Consequently, Yamada village set us  4 requirements as follows: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A system that allows the social services department to occasionally  observe bedridden elderly people.</li>
<li>A system that check poeople as they work in the fields since many accidents have happened n the past.</li>
<li>A system that watching the environment of the village for elderly people</li>
<li>A system that can be extended to support tele-agriculture.</li>
</ol>
<p>To meet these requirements, we provided system that made full use of our fundamental technology.  This system utilizes broadband networks and omnidirectional cameras to visualize the environment of Yamada village;  it is a prototype of the future information infrastructure.</p>
<p>This system remotely monitors a specific field using omnidirectional cameras and environmental sensors. Also, by using a human tracking system, the system can monitor the field workers.  Moreover, the data collected by environmental sensors can be used for tele-agriculture, environmental protection, etc.  By visualizing the village with Town Digitizing, visitors in other countries can  participate in village life.</p>
<p>This application started in November 2001.  To refine this system, we are still conducting  research and development activities. We have already installed several omnidirectional cameras in Yamada village.</p>
