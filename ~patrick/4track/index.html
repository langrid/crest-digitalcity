<h3>Old 4-track stuff</h3>

These are some short 4-track recordings I made in my apartment
while I was living in Brooklyn. I don't like them that much
because the playing is kind of sloppy, but I found them lying
around so I decided to put them on a web page as I don't have
anything new to show.

So here they are:

This is the second thing I did with my 4-track. It's 2
tracks of my telecaster, one track of jazz bass, and
one drum track provided by Dr. Rythem. Maybe this could
be called southern rock?

This is the first thing I recorded after buying my 4-track.
Like the recording above it 2 tracks tele, 1 track jazz bass, and
Dr. Rythem is on the drum track again. Pretty lame punk-ish
stuff going on.

This might be the recording I'm least ashamed of. A little 7/4
math rock-ish thing. What I like most is the distorted jazz bass
sound. This is 3 tracks of my Jag, jazz bass, and Dr. Rythem.

Don't really remember when I did this, but I know I woke up
one morning and had this idea. I recorded it quickly before I
went to work. When i got home I listened to it again and didn't
like it. This time it's one track of Jaguar, one jazz bass, and a
lazy Dr. Rythem track.

My friend's band had this song that I thought was interesting but
I thought it would be cooler if it was faster then they did it,
in an odd meter, and with some electronic instruments. I think I
was wrong. <a href=Moonshine_Messiahs-break_it_down.mp3>Here</a>
is a version of the Moonshine Messiahs, my friend's band, doing
their song.
