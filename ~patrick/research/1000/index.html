<h2>kyoto-wel.com Site Enhancement Proposal</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>
Proposed are navigational improvements to the web site, www.kyoto-wel.com.  Improvements will include relational navigation by location, store type, and products; search by location via map and list; and improved navigation tools for inclusion in existing html documents.  Relational navigation functionality will be acheived through database modification.  Search by location will be accomplished by database modification and creation of visual navigation tools (navigable maps).  Improved navigation tools will consist of html templates

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<p>
The schedule for completion is tentatively 4 months.  This time frame is a very rough estimate.  A more precise schedule will be presented after a 1 week evaluation period of existing database and application infrastructure, after which the schedule may be increased by a time period of no greater than 2 months.

<h3>Organization</h3>

<p>
Project members will include YASUOKA Mika, ISHIDA Toru and Patrick Bolduan from Digital City, and a representative from www.kyoto-wel.com.  Digital City will be responsible for providing a software product at the conclusion of the project.  www.kyoto-wel.com will be responsible for answering questions posed by Digital City team members and allowing access by Digital City team members to existing code and database elements of www.kyoto-wel.com.

<h3>Product</h3>

<p>
Products to be delivered at the end of this project are: 
<ul>
<li>New DDL's
<li>API's for accessing new data definitions
<li>A content management tool set for managing content contained in the new
database definitions
<li>HTML and flash templates for navigation tools
<li>Documentation and sample code
</ul>

<h3>Service</h3>

<p>
Digital City team members will make themselves available to developers at www.kyoto-wel.com for a period of 1 month after the product delivery date for assistance in implementing new DDL's, API's, HTML and flash.  After this 1 month period expires, a new service agreement will have to be discussed or service from Digital City to www.kyoto-wel.com will end.

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>
Costs incurred during the development phase of this project will be borne by Digital City.  At the conclusion of development, software and support (support will be available only during the period defined in the service section of this proposal) will be provided to www.kyoto-wel.com by Digital City free-of-charge.  Costs incurred during deployment of software provided by Digital City will be the responsibility of www.kyoto-wel.com.  In exchange for software and support from Digital City, www.kyoto-wel.com will provide Digital City with access to weekly copies of database information that is managed by the software from Digital City.
