I got a table for my dining room. It's really small and actually it's
a desk, but i think it will work for now. I got it from the recycle
furnature shop which you'd think would be really cheap, but it was
like 3500 yen. A little much i thought for a crappy used desk.

I replaced the tiny table/desk with a good table. And becase the new
table was so much bigger, i need a bigger rug. so there is a new rug
too.

Kitchen/Bath/Laundry room. Bath view. The toilet is in the front of the house.
The blurry thing behind the glass is my sentakki (washing machine). I'm getting
a dryer that will go on top of it in a few days. I'm so psyched about not having
to haul my clothes to the laundromat anymore.

I got my 2 couches for the living room. I also got some covers
from this hippy store at the mall. I felt so middle-American.
Now I need a longer anteana wire so I can put the TV somewhere
else. I also want to reaplace that cardboard box with real furnature;
although it's working pretty well for now.

After I got the new rug rof the dining room I was able to move the
old one up to the living room. I moved the little table up too.
Now i think the house is in about the condition i want it to be in.
Except some lights. I'm still going to be replacing lights. Some
of the lights that came with the house are really ugly.
