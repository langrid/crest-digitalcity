This type of van is pretty common in Kyoto. It's got loud speakers
attached to the roof. I think these vans are used for people running
for public office or by people that want the emperor to come back to
Kyoto from Tokyo. I'm told that getting the emperor back to Kyoto is a
very popular theme of by these people with these vans. I think this one
was someone running for public office. This one was a loop of some people
talking, but there are some in my neighborhood that drive around playing
what I'm told are Japanese war songs. They rock!

Here's another truck with a loud speaker on top. It was saying something
about it being a red truck and instructing people to do something with
their newspapers and plastic bags. I'm not sure what though.

This is another varation on the truck with a loud speaker thing. Its a guy
without a truck, but still has a loud speaker and apparently something to
tell everybody. I think he was making some kind of political speach. I saw
him wrapping up his street corner speaking time by passing out some
propoganda.

I found where the guys that want the emperor to come back to Kyoto park
their trucks. It's kind of near my house. They park by the mall.

Here's another guy without a truck, but still has something to say. I
think he was trying to get people to go to the movie theater. The woman
in the yellow shirt is bulrry because she saw that I was trying to take
a picture so she was rushing to get out of the frame. Many Japanese
people are very polite.

Here's kind of a hybrid version of this method of public speaking.
These guys have a truck but choose to stand on top of it, negating
(I think) the advantage of having a truck, which is making your
message mobile. These are polititions. The guy on the left smiled
and waved after I took this picture. I think the guys that want
the emperor to come back aren't as friendly, but that's only because
I saw one of their trucks recently and the only word I could pick out
from the guys speach was "baka", which means stupid or foolish. He
was yelling it repetedly
