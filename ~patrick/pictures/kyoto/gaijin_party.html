Scott and Frederic, these 2 visiting researchers that are here for 2 months
had a little party at their mansion. I went. And took pictures.

Fred looks like he's helping in this shot, but I think he just wanted
to be close to the ladies. Scott is probably demanding finished food
so he can eat.

I decided to get drunk at this party. Mika has my camera at this
point and I'm getting pretty close to being completely gone.

Mika's still got my camera and I'm still hanging in. I know because
I've still got a beer in this picture and I wasn't completly drunk
until the wiskey started.

If you'll look to the right of this picture you will notice some wiskey.
After this point my memory of what was happening is very fuzzy.

Looks like I got my camera back from Mika, but as far a I know, anyone
could have taken this picture.

Here i'm eating some rice. I'm told that along with this bowl of rice that
I'm working on in this picture, that I ate about half of the total amount
of all the food at the party.

I'm told that after one of my trips to the toilet (not to vomit, only #1)
that no one was able to open the bathroom door, as i had closed it so
tightly. I'm also told that i found this very funny and insisted on taking
a picture of someone not being able to get into the bathroom. Apparently
I was able to open the door with no trouble.

I have no recolection of this...
