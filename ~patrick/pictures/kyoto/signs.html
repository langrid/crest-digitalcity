to Captain Santa.

This is a rental shop near my house. I like the illustration of the
brain with legs running. I'm told that they are really cheap so
i think i may soon be a Magical Brain member.

This is this ramen shop I like. Not really interesting from
the outside. This picture is mainly for my friend that also
lives in the same area as I so they know what this place looks
like.

This isn't so much a sign, but it is in front of the clothing
store at the end of my drive whenever they are open. It's a
good landmark for finding my house.

I'm not sure what this one is about. It's on what looks like an
appartment building and above a circle-K. I like it though.

This is another view of the FREAKS sign. In this one you can clearly
see it's proximity to the circle-K

Kentucky Fried Chicken places in Japan all sport a stylish
Colonel Sanders out front. I think he's one of the only other
Americans in my neighborhood. I kind of want to get a fake
chicken and put it in the Colonel's hands. Or maybe a real one...

This Colonel Sanders is a little more sporty. I found him outside
a flower shop on Nijo-dori. I'm not sure what he's doing peddeling
flowers though.

Another view of the flower shop Sanders. One of my friends had this
comment about this Sanders: "kentucky no ojisan, arubaito da~me
da~me ne~". Which means she's not so big on the Colonel's part time
job. My feeling is, "the colonel's got to do what the colonel's got
to do."

This is a small Sanders. He's wearing yukata and has a fan that reads
matsuri. He's ready to party. Matsuri! Not really a sign but he's
included here to round out the Sanders Series.

This sign is posted along Kamo River. I like the "no golf" partly
because I don't like golf that much and partly because I think
it's funny that golfers would be enough of a problem in any
public space that a no golfers sign would have to be posted. also,
as the golfer pictured here is wearing special golf pants, i wonder
your're not allowed to wear silly golf pants by the river. The X is
in the pants area of the golfer...

This is an okonomiyaki shop in Teramachi, a pedestrian shopping
area in the Kawaramachi-Shijo shopping district (related to one
of my research projects). The name can't really hold a candle to
captain santa but it's still pretty good.

This crab is also in Teramachi. It's animatronic! Maybe I'll take
a series of pictures sometime and make an animation.

This sign is at the Daimon-ji trailhead. i like that the kid is
yelling for help in English. The japanese says the area is
dangerous (abunai!) and not to play there (koko de wa asobanai).
i also like that the kids hat reads "danger." that kid could be
nothing but trouble walking around in a hat like that. oh, also,
the water on the other side is one or two inches deep.

I think what I like most about this sign is the fact that the fish
is the only photorealistic element. Black and white photo at that.
everything else is color illustration. This was a train station in
Osaka.

The Hotel Sexus. This is in the area where the high school age catch girls
hang out. Not sure if it's a love hotel or was just poorly named.
