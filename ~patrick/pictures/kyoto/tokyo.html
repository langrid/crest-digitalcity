I took a trip to Tokyo to visit my friends Bryan, Liling, and Wakana.
I got see all of them and had a pretty good time. I kind of didn't
get around to taking pictures of my friends, but i did take pictures of
some strange things i saw. This is a trash can with some hair coming out
of it.

This building is in Asakusa. Wakana lives in Asakusa and tells me that
this building is known as "unchi biru"  or "poo building"

In the unchi biru picture, there's something strange going on. Take
a look at the elevated roadway in this enlarged portion. I want to
know what that van is up to. Thanks to Shoko for pointing this out
