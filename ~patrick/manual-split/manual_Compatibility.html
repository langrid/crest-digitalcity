<H1><A NAME="Compatibility" HREF="manual_toc.html#Compatibility">5  How Standards-compatible Is MySQL?</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes how <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> relates to the ANSI SQL standards.
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> has many extensions to the ANSI SQL standards, and here you
will find out what they are, and how to use them.  You will also find 
information about functionality missing from <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, and how to work 
around some differences.  

</P>


<H2><A NAME="Extensions_to_ANSI" HREF="manual_toc.html#Extensions_to_ANSI">5.1  MySQL Extensions to ANSI SQL92</A></H2>

<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> includes some extensions that you probably will not find in
other SQL databases.  Be warned that if you use them, your code will not be
portable to other SQL servers.  In some cases, you can write code that
includes <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> extensions, but is still portable, by using comments
of the form <CODE>/*! ... */</CODE>.  In this case, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> will parse and
execute the code within the comment as it would any other <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
statement, but other SQL servers will ignore the extensions.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col_name FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...
</PRE>

<P>
If you add a version number after the <CODE>'!'</CODE>, the syntax will only be
executed if the <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> version is equal to or newer than the used
version number:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE /*!32302 TEMPORARY */ TABLE (a int);
</PRE>

<P>
The above means that if you have Version 3.23.02 or newer, then <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
will use the <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> keyword.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> extensions are listed below:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The field types <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>, <CODE>SET</CODE>, <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, and the
different <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types.

<LI>

The field attributes <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>, <CODE>BINARY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, and <CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE>.

<LI>

All string comparisons are case insensitive by default, with sort
ordering determined by the current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by
default).  If you don't like this, you should declare your columns with
the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute or use the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> cast, which causes
comparisons to be done according to the ASCII order used on the
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> server host.

<LI>

<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> maps each database to a directory under the <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
data directory, and tables within a database to filenames in the database
directory.

This has a few implications:

<A NAME="IDX324"></A>
<A NAME="IDX325"></A>
<A NAME="IDX326"></A>
<A NAME="IDX327"></A>


<UL>

<LI>

Database names and table names are case sensitive in <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> on
operating systems that have case-sensitive filenames (like most Unix
systems). See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#Name_case_sensitivity">7.1.5.1  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<LI>

Database, table, index, column, or alias names may begin with a digit
(but may not consist solely of digits).

<LI>

You can use standard system commands to backup, rename, move, delete, and copy
tables.  For example, to rename a table, rename the <TT>`.MYD'</TT>, <TT>`.MYI'</TT>,
and <TT>`.frm'</TT> files to which the table corresponds.
</UL>

<LI>

In SQL statements, you can access tables from different databases
with the <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> syntax.  Some SQL servers provide
the same functionality but call this <CODE>User space</CODE>.
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> doesn't support tablespaces as in:
<CODE>create table ralph.my_table...IN my_tablespace</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> is allowed on numeric columns.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE> and <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#SELECT">7.19  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE> option in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.

<LI>

<CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT</CODE> to get a description on how tables are joined.

<LI>

Use of index names, indexes on a prefix of a field, and use of
<CODE>INDEX</CODE> or <CODE>KEY</CODE> in a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#CREATE_TABLE">7.7  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> or <CODE>IF NOT EXISTS</CODE> with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT list)</CODE> where 'list' is more than one element.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>CHANGE col_name</CODE>, <CODE>DROP col_name</CODE>, or <CODE>DROP
INDEX</CODE>, <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> or <CODE>RENAME</CODE> in an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#ALTER_TABLE">7.8  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#RENAME_TABLE">7.9  <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use of multiple <CODE>ADD</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER</CODE>, <CODE>DROP</CODE>, or <CODE>CHANGE</CODE>
clauses in an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> with the keywords <CODE>IF EXISTS</CODE>.

<LI>

You can drop multiple tables with a single <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

The <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause of the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

The <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> clause of the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>
statements.

<LI>

The <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> clause of the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.

<A NAME="IDX328"></A>
<A NAME="IDX329"></A>
<LI>

Use of <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. In many cases, this syntax is compatible with
Oracle's <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#LOAD_DATA">7.23  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>, and
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> statements.

<LI>

The <CODE>SHOW</CODE> statement.
See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#SHOW">7.28  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Strings may be enclosed by either <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`''</SAMP>, not just by <SAMP>`''</SAMP>.

<LI>

Use of the escape <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character.

<LI>

The <CODE>SET OPTION</CODE> statement. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#SET_OPTION">7.33  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You don't need to name all selected columns in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part.
This gives better performance for some very specific, but quite normal
queries.
See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#Group_by_functions">7.4.13  Functions for Use with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> Clauses</A>.

<LI>

One can specify <CODE>ASC</CODE> and <CODE>DESC</CODE> with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.

<LI>

To make it easier for users who come from other SQL environments,
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> supports aliases for many functions. For example, all
string functions support both ANSI SQL syntax and ODBC syntax.

<LI>

<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> understands the <CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>&#38;&</CODE> operators to mean
logical OR and AND, as in the C programming language.  In <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>,
<CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>OR</CODE> are synonyms, as are <CODE>&#38;&</CODE> and <CODE>AND</CODE>.
Because of this nice syntax, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> doesn't support
the ANSI SQL <CODE>||</CODE> operator for string concatenation; use
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> instead. Because <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> takes any number
of arguments, it's easy to convert use of the <CODE>||</CODE> operator to
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.

<LI>

<CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> or <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#CREATE_DATABASE">7.5  <CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
<A NAME="IDX331"></A>
<LI>

The <CODE>%</CODE> operator is a synonym for <CODE>MOD()</CODE>.  That is,
<CODE>N % M</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>MOD(N,M)</CODE>.  <CODE>%</CODE> is supported
for C programmers and for compatibility with PostgreSQL.

<LI>

The <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=</CODE> ,<CODE>&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;=</CODE>,<CODE>&#62;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>AND</CODE>, <CODE>OR</CODE>, or <CODE>LIKE</CODE>
operators may be used in column comparisons to the left of the
<CODE>FROM</CODE> in <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col1=1 AND col2=2 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function.
See section <A HREF="manual_Clients.html#mysql_insert_id">24.1.3.126  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> and <CODE>NOT REGEXP</CODE> extended regular expression
operators.

<LI>

<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> or <CODE>CHAR()</CODE> with one argument or more than two
arguments.  (In <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, these functions can take any number of
arguments.)

<LI>The <CODE>BIT_COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>CASE</CODE>, <CODE>ELT()</CODE>,

<CODE>FROM_DAYS()</CODE>, <CODE>FORMAT()</CODE>, <CODE>IF()</CODE>, <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>,
<CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE>, <CODE>md5()</CODE>, <CODE>ENCODE()</CODE>, <CODE>DECODE()</CODE>,
<CODE>PERIOD_ADD()</CODE>, <CODE>PERIOD_DIFF()</CODE>, <CODE>TO_DAYS()</CODE>, or
<CODE>WEEKDAY()</CODE> functions.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>TRIM()</CODE> to trim substrings. ANSI SQL only supports removal
of single characters.

<LI>

The <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> functions <CODE>STD()</CODE>, <CODE>BIT_OR()</CODE>, and
<CODE>BIT_AND()</CODE>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> instead of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> + <CODE>INSERT</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#REPLACE">7.22  <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>FLUSH flush_option</CODE> statement.

<LI>

The possibility to set variables in a statement with <CODE>:=</CODE>:

<PRE>
SELECT @a:=SUM(total),@b=COUNT(*),@a/@b AS avg FROM test_table;
SELECT @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4,@t1,@t2,@t3;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX332"></A>
<A NAME="IDX333"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--ansi</CODE> option, the following behavior
of <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> changes:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>||</CODE> is string concatenation instead of <CODE>OR</CODE>.
<LI>

You can have any number of spaces between a function name and the <SAMP>`('</SAMP>.
This forces all function names to be treated as reserved words.
<LI>

<SAMP>`"'</SAMP> will be an identifier quote character (like the <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
<SAMP>``'</SAMP> quote character) and not a string quote character.
<LI>

<CODE>REAL</CODE> will be a synonym for <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> instead of a synonym of
<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>.
<LI>

The default transaction isolation level is <CODE>SERIALIZABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#SET_TRANSACTION">7.34  <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="Differences_from_ANSI" HREF="manual_toc.html#Differences_from_ANSI">5.3  MySQL Differences Compared to ANSI SQL92</A></H2>

<P>
We try to make <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> follow the ANSI SQL standard and the
ODBC SQL standard, but in some cases <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> does some things
differently:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>--</CODE> is only a comment if followed by a white space. See section <A HREF="manual_Compatibility.html#Missing_comments">5.4.7  <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as the Start of a Comment</A>.
<LI>

For <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, trailing spaces are removed when the value is
stored. See section <A HREF="manual_Bugs.html#Bugs">G  Known errors and design deficiencies in MySQL</A>.
<LI>

In some cases, <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns are silently changed to <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
columns. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#Silent_column_changes">7.7.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.
<LI>

Privileges for a table are not automatically revoked when you delete a
table. You must explicitly issue a <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> to revoke privileges for
a table. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#GRANT">7.35  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

<CODE>NULL AND FALSE</CODE> will evaluate to <CODE>NULL</CODE> and not to <CODE>FALSE</CODE>.
This is because we don't think it's good to have to evaluate a lot of
extra conditions in this case.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="Missing_functions" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_functions">5.4  Functionality Missing from MySQL</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX334"></A>
<A NAME="IDX335"></A>

</P>
<P>
The following functionality is missing in the current version of
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.  For a prioritized list indicating when new extensions
may be added to <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, you should consult
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php?section=TODO"> the
online <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> TODO list</a>. That is the latest version of the TODO
list in this manual. See section <A HREF="manual_TODO.html#TODO">H  MySQL and the future (The TODO)</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Missing_Sub-selects" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_Sub-selects">5.4.1  Sub-selects</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX336"></A>

</P>
<P>
The following will not yet work in <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM table2 where table1.id=table2.id);
</PRE>

<P>
However, in many cases you can rewrite the query without a sub-select:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT table1.* FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id=table2.id;
SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id where table2.id IS NULL
</PRE>

<P>
For more complicated subqueries you can often create temporary tables
to hold the subquery.  In some cases, however this option will not
work. The most frequently encountered of these cases arises with
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements, for which standard SQL does not support joins
(except in sub-selects).  For this situation there are two options
available until subqueries are supported by <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
The first option is to use a procedural programming language (such as
Perl or PHP) to submit a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query to obtain the primary keys
for the records to be deleted, and then use these values to construct
the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement (<CODE>DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... IN (key1,
key2, ...)</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
The second option is to use interactive SQL to contruct a set of
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements automatically, using the <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
extension <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> (in lieu of the standard <CODE>||</CODE> operator).
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT CONCAT('DELETE FROM tab1 WHERE pkid = ', tab1.pkid, ';')
  FROM tab1, tab2
 WHERE tab1.col1 = tab2.col2;
</PRE>

<P>
You can place this query in a script file and redirect input from it to
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line interpreter, piping its output back to a
second instance of the interpreter:

</P>

<PRE>
prompt&#62; mysql --skip-column-names mydb &#60; myscript.sql | mysql mydb
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> only supports <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT ...</CODE> and
<CODE>REPLACE ... SELECT ...</CODE> Independent sub-selects will probably
be available in Version 4.0.  You can now use the function <CODE>IN()</CODE> in
other contexts, however.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Missing_SELECT_INTO_TABLE" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_SELECT_INTO_TABLE">5.4.2  <CODE>SELECT INTO TABLE</CODE></A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX337"></A>

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> doesn't yet support the Oracle SQL extension:
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO TABLE ...</CODE>.  <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> supports instead the
ANSI SQL syntax <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...</CODE>, which is basically
the same thing. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#INSERT_SELECT">7.21.1  <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO tblTemp2 (fldID) SELECT tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID FROM tblTemp1 WHERE
tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID &#62; 100;
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, you can use <CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE...</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT</CODE> to solve your problem.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Missing_Transactions" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_Transactions">5.4.3  Transactions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX338"></A>

</P>
<P>
As <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> does nowadays support transactions, the following
discussion is only valid if you are only using the non-transaction-safe
table types. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#COMMIT">7.31  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The question is often asked, by the curious and the critical, ``Why is
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> not a transactional database?'' or ``Why does <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
not support transactions?''

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> has made a conscious decision to support another paradigm
for data integrity, ``atomic operations.'' It is our thinking and
experience that atomic operations offer equal or even better integrity
with much better performance. We, nonetheless, appreciate and understand
the transactional database paradigm and plan, within the next few releases,
to introduce transaction-safe tables on a per table basis. We will be
giving our users the possibility to decide if they need the speed of
atomic operations or if they need to use transactional features in their
applications.

</P>
<P>
How does one use the features of <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> to maintain rigorous integrity
and how do these features compare with the transactional paradigm?

</P>
<P>
First, in the transactional paradigm, if your applications are written
in a way that is dependent on the calling of ``rollback'' instead of
``commit'' in critical situations, then transactions are more
convenient. Moreover, transactions ensure that unfinished updates or
corrupting activities are not committed to the database; the server is
given the opportunity to do an automatic rollback and your database is
saved.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, in almost all cases, allows you to solve for potential
problems by including simple checks before updates and by running simple
scripts that check the databases for inconsistencies and automatically
repair or warn if such occurs. Note that just by using the
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> log or even adding one extra log, one can normally fix
tables perfectly with no data integrity loss.

</P>
<P>
Moreover, fatal transactional updates can be rewritten to be
atomic. In fact,we will go so far as to say that all integrity problems
that transactions solve can be done with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> or atomic updates,
ensuring that you never will get an automatic abort from the database,
which is a common problem with transactional databases.

</P>
<P>
Not even transactions can prevent all loss if the server goes down.  In
such cases even a transactional system can lose data.  The difference
between different systems lies in just how small the time-lap is where
they could lose data. No system is 100% secure, only ``secure
enough.'' Even Oracle, reputed to be the safest of transactional
databases, is reported to sometimes lose data in such situations.

</P>
<P>
To be safe with <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, you only need to have backups and have
the update logging turned on.  With this you can recover from any
situation that you could with any transactional database.  It is, of
course, always good to have backups, independent of which database you
use.

</P>
<P>
The transactional paradigm has its benefits and its drawbacks. Many
users and application developers depend on the ease with which they can
code around problems where an abort appears to be, or is necessary, and they
may have to do a little more work with <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> to either think
differently or write more. If you are new to the atomic operations
paradigm, or more familiar or more comfortable with transactions, do not
jump to the conclusion that <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> has not addressed these
issues. Reliability and integrity are foremost in our minds.  Recent
estimates indicate that there are more than 1,000,000 <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers
currently running, many of which are in production environments.  We
hear very, very seldom from our users that they have lost any data, and
in almost all of those cases user error is involved. This is, in our
opinion, the best proof of <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>'s stability and reliability.

</P>
<P>
Lastly, in situations where integrity is of highest importance,
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>'s current features allow for transaction-level or better
reliability and integrity. If you lock tables with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, all
updates will stall until any integrity checks are made.  If you only obtain
a read lock (as opposed to a write lock), then reads and inserts are
still allowed to happen.  The new inserted records will not be seen by
any of the clients that have a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock until they release their read
locks.  With <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> you can queue inserts into a local queue,
until the locks are released, without having the client wait for the insert
to complete. See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#INSERT_DELAYED">7.21.2  <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
``Atomic,'' in the sense that we mean it, is nothing magical. It only means
that you can be sure that while each specific update is running, no other
user can interfere with it, and there will never be an automatic
rollback (which can happen on transaction based systems if you are not
very careful).  <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> also guarantees that there will not be
any dirty reads.  You can find some example of how to write atomic updates
in the commit-rollback section. See section <A HREF="manual_Compatibility.html#Commit-rollback">5.6  How to Cope Without <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>/<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
We have thought quite a bit about integrity and performance, and we
believe that our atomic operations paradigm allows for both high
reliability and extremely high performance, on the order of three to
five times the speed of the fastest and most optimally tuned of
transactional databases. We didn't leave out transactions because they
are hard to do. The main reason we went with atomic operations as
opposed to transactions is that by doing this we could apply many speed
optimizations that would not otherwise have been possible.

</P>
<P>
Many of our users who have speed foremost in their minds are not at all
concerned about transactions. For them transactions are not an
issue. For those of our users who are concerned with or have wondered
about transactions vis-a-vis <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, there is a ``<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
way'' as we have outlined above.  For those where safety is more
important than speed, we recommend them to use the <CODE>BDB</CODE>,
<CODE>GEMINI</CODE> or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables for all their critical
data. See section <A HREF="manual_Table_types.html#Table_types">8  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
One final note: We are currently working on a safe replication schema
that we believe to be better than any commercial replication system we
know of. This system will work most reliably under the atomic
operations, non-transactional, paradigm. Stay tuned.

<H3><A NAME="Missing_Triggers" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_Triggers">5.4.4  Stored Procedures and Triggers</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX339"></A>
<A NAME="IDX340"></A>
<A NAME="IDX341"></A>

</P>

<P>
A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that can be compiled and stored
in the server. Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep reissuing
the entire query but can refer to the stored procedure. This provides better
performance because the query has to be parsed only once, and less information
needs to be sent between the server and the client. You can also raise the
conceptual level by having libraries of functions in the server.

</P>
<P>
A trigger is a stored procedure that is invoked when a particular event
occurs.  For example, you can install a stored procedure that is triggered
each time a record is deleted from a transaction table and that automatically
deletes the corresponding customer from a customer table when all his
transactions are deleted.

</P>
<P>
The planned update language will be able to
handle stored procedures, but without triggers. Triggers usually slow
down everything, even queries for which they are not needed.

</P>
<P>
To see when <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> might get stored procedures, see section <A HREF="manual_TODO.html#TODO">H  MySQL and the future (The TODO)</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX342"></A>
<A NAME="IDX343"></A>

Note that foreign keys in SQL are not used to join tables, but are used
mostly for checking referential integrity (foreign key constraints).  If
you want to get results from multiple tables from a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement, you do this by joining tables:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * from table1,table2 where table1.id = table2.id;
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#JOIN">7.20  <CODE>JOIN</CODE> Syntax</A>. See section <A HREF="manual_Tutorial.html#example-Foreign_keys">9.5.6  Using Foreign Keys</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax in <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> exists only for compatibility
with other SQL vendors' <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> commands; it doesn't do
anything.  The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax without <CODE>ON DELETE ...</CODE> is
mostly used for documentation purposes. Some ODBC applications may use this
to produce automatic <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses, but this is usually easy to
override. <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> is sometimes used as a constraint check, but
this check is unnecessary in practice if rows are inserted into the tables in
the right order. <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> only supports these clauses because some
applications require them to exist (regardless of whether or not they
work).

</P>
<P>
In <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>, you can work around the problem of <CODE>ON DELETE
...</CODE> not being implemented by adding the appropriate <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement to
an application when you delete records from a table that has a foreign key.
In practice this is as quick (in some cases quicker) and much more portable
than using foreign keys.

</P>
<P>
In the near future we will extend the <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> implementation so
that at least the information will be saved in the table specification file
and may be retrieved by <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and ODBC. At a later stage we will
implement the foreign key constraints for application that can't easily be
coded to avoid them.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX344"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are so many problems with foreign key constraints that we don't
know where to start:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Foreign key constraints make life very complicated, because the foreign
key definitions must be stored in a database and implementing them would
destroy the whole ``nice approach'' of using files that can be moved,
copied, and removed.

<LI>

The speed impact is terrible for <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements, and in this case almost all <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> constraint
checks are useless because you usually insert records in the right
tables in the right order, anyway.

<LI>

There is also a need to hold locks on many more tables when updating one
table, because the side effects can cascade through the entire database. It's
MUCH faster to delete records from one table first and subsequently delete
them from the other tables.

<LI>

You can no longer restore a table by doing a full delete from the table
and then restoring all records (from a new source or from a backup).

<LI>

If you use foreign key constraints you can't dump and restore tables
unless you do so in a very specific order.

<LI>

It's very easy to do ``allowed'' circular definitions that make the
tables impossible to re-create each table with a single create statement,
even if the definition works and is usable.

<LI>

It's very easy to overlook <CODE>FOREIGN KEY ... ON DELETE</CODE> rules when
one codes an application. It's not unusual that one loses a lot of
important information just because a wrong or misused <CODE>ON DELETE</CODE> rule.
</UL>

<P>
The only nice aspect of <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> is that it gives ODBC and some
other client programs the ability to see how a table is connected and to use
this to show connection diagrams and to help in building applications.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> will soon store <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> definitions so that a
client can ask for and receive an answer about how the original
connection was made. The current <TT>`.frm'</TT> file format does not have
any place for it.  At a later stage we will implement the foreign key
constraints for application that can't easily be coded to avoid them.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Missing_Views" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_Views">5.4.6  Views</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX345"></A>

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> doesn't yet support views, but we plan to implement these
to about 4.1.

</P>
<P>
Views are mostly useful for letting users access a set of relations as one
table (in read-only mode).  Many SQL databases don't allow one to update
any rows in a view, but you have to do the updates in the separate tables.

</P>
<P>
As <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> is mostly used in applications and on web system where
the application writer has full control on the database usage, most of
our users haven't regarded views to be very important. (At least no one
has been interested enough in this to be prepared to finance the
implementation of views).

</P>
<P>
One doesn't need views in <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> to restrict access to columns
as <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> has a very sophisticated privilege
system. See section <A HREF="manual_Privilege_system.html#Privilege_system">6  The MySQL Access Privilege System</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Missing_comments" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_comments">5.4.7  <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as the Start of a Comment</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX346"></A>
<A NAME="IDX347"></A>

</P>
<P>
Some other SQL databases use <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> to start comments. <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
has <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> as the start comment character, even if the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
command-line tool removes all lines that start with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>.
You can also use the C comment style <CODE>/* this is a comment */</CODE> with
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.
See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#Comments">7.38  Comment Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> Version 3.23.3 and above supports the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> comment style
only if the comment is followed by a space.  This is because this
degenerate comment style has caused many problems with automatically
generated SQL queries that have used something like the following code,
where we automatically insert the value of the payment for
<CODE>!payment!</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit-!payment!
</PRE>

<P>
What do you think will happen when the value of <CODE>payment</CODE> is negative?

</P>
<P>
Because <CODE>1--1</CODE> is legal in SQL, we think it is terrible that
<SAMP>`--'</SAMP> means start comment.

</P>
<P>
In <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> Version 3.23 you can, however, use:
<CODE>1-- This is a comment</CODE>

</P>
<P>
The following discussion only concerns you if you are running a <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>
version earlier than Version 3.23:

</P>
<P>
If you have a SQL program in a text file that contains <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> comments
you should use:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " --" " #" &#60; text-file-with-funny-comments.sql \
         | mysql database
</PRE>

<P>
instead of the usual:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database &#60; text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
</PRE>

<P>
You can also edit the command file ``in place'' to change the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>
comments to <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> comments:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " --" " #" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
</PRE>

<P>
Change them back with this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " #" " --" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
</PRE>

The following mostly applies only for <CODE>ISAM</CODE>, <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, and
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables. If you only use transaction-safe tables (<CODE>BDB</CODE>,
<CODE>GEMINI</CODE> or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables) in an an update, you can do
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> also with <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG>.
See section <A HREF="manual_Reference.html#COMMIT">7.31  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The problem with handling <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>-<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> efficiently with
the above table types would require a completely different table layout
than <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> uses today.  The table type would also need extra
threads that do automatic cleanups on the tables, and the disk usage
would be much higher. This would make these table types about 2-4 times
slower than they are today.

</P>
<P>
For the moment, we prefer implementing the SQL server language (something
like stored procedures). With this you would very seldom really need
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE>-<CODE>ROLLBACK.</CODE> This would also give much better performance.

</P>
<P>
Loops that need transactions normally can be coded with the help of
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, and you don't need cursors when you can update records
on the fly.

</P>
<P>
We at TcX had a greater need for a real fast database than a 100%
general database. Whenever we find a way to implement these features without
any speed loss, we will probably do it. For the moment, there are many more
important things to do. Check the TODO for how we prioritize things at
the moment. (Customers with higher levels of support can alter this, so
things may be reprioritized.)

</P>
<P>
The current problem is actually <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>. Without
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, you can do any kind of <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> action with
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>. To support <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> with the above table
types, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> would have to be changed to store all old records
that were updated and revert everything back to the starting point if
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> was issued. For simple cases, this isn't that hard to do
(the current <CODE>isamlog</CODE> could be used for this purpose), but it
would be much more difficult to implement <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> for
<CODE>ALTER/DROP/CREATE TABLE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To avoid using <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, you can use the following strategy:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Use <CODE>LOCK TABLES ...</CODE> to lock all the tables you want to access.
<LI>

Test conditions.
<LI>

Update if everything is okay.
<LI>

Use <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> to release your locks.
</OL>

<P>
This is usually a much faster method than using transactions with possible
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>s, although not always. The only situation this solution
doesn't handle is when someone kills the threads in the middle of an
update. In this case, all locks will be released but some of the updates may
not have been executed.

</P>
<P>
You can also use functions to update records in a single operation.
You can get a very efficient application by using the following techniques:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Modify fields relative to their current value.

<LI>Update only those fields that actually have changed.

</UL>

<P>
For example, when we are doing updates to some customer information, we
update only the customer data that has changed and test only that none of
the changed data, or data that depend on the changed data, has changed
compared to the original row. The test for changed data is done with the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause in the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement. If the record wasn't
updated, we give the client a message: "Some of the data you have changed
have been changed by another user". Then we show the old row versus the new
row in a window, so the user can decide which version of the customer record
he should use.

</P>
<P>
This gives us something that is similar to column locking but is actually
even better, because we only update some of the columns, using values that
are relative to their current values.  This means that typical <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements look something like these:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tablename SET pay_back=pay_back+'relative change';

UPDATE customer
  SET
    customer_date='current_date',
    address='new address',
    phone='new phone',
    money_he_owes_us=money_he_owes_us+'new_money'
  WHERE
    customer_id=id AND address='old address' AND phone='old phone';
</PRE>

<P>
As you can see, this is very efficient and works even if another client has
changed the values in the <CODE>pay_back</CODE> or <CODE>money_he_owes_us</CODE> columns.

</P>
<P>

In many cases, users have wanted <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> and/or <CODE>LOCK
TABLES</CODE> for the purpose of managing unique identifiers for some tables. This
can be handled much more efficiently by using an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column
and either the SQL function <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> or the C API function
<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual_Clients.html#mysql_insert_id">24.1.3.126  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX358"></A>
At <STRONG>MySQL AB</STRONG>, we have never had any need for row-level locking
because we have always been able to code around it. Some cases really need
row locking, but they are very few. If you want row-level locking, you
can use a flag column in the table and do something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID;
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> returns 1 for the number of affected rows if the row was
found and <CODE>row_flag</CODE> wasn't already 1 in the original row.

</P>
<P>
You can think of it as <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> changed the above query to:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID and row_flag &#60;&#62; 1;
</PRE>
