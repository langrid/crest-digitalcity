<H3>Overview</H3>

<P align=justify> People are starting to use the Internet,
not only in business but in their daily life as well.
The Internet for business needs to be a homogeneous and
logical information space.
On the other hand,
the Internet for everyday life should be a space that is heterogeneous and
contains rich information reflecting cultural characteristics of a local area.
For example, patients suffering from high blood pressure do not require
the Internet as a worldwide network.
Instead, they need the Internet as a space that encompasses everyday life
information of the surrounding vicinities.
</P>

<P align=justify> Digital cities, accumulating the local information through a new media,
will provide a social information infrastructure to community networks.
The objective of this project is
<SPAN STYLE="color: red">to create digital cities
as an infrastructure used and participated
by all people, including the handicapped and the aged.</SPAN>
However, the high cost of developing systems specifically
for the handicapped and the aged, in return, burdens them.
Therefore, it is necessary to design the Digital City
from the beginning so that everyone can use this information space
without any barriers. The universal design of digital cities -useable
for all people- is indispensable for creating the information space
for daily life. In this project,
we will develop basic technologies for the universal design,
subject to 'sending information', 'receiving information',
and 'participation'.

<H3>Technologies</H3>

<P align=justify> Digital Cities have used technologies
such as geological information systems,
virtual space and mobile computing.
In our project, we carry out basic researches
into the information infrastructure called
<SPAN STYLE="color: red">perceptional information infrastructure (PII)</SPAN>
and the software called
<SPAN STYLE="color: red">social agents</SPAN>.
In PII, we create an omni-directional vision network.
It models the function of environmental static and human active structures
to accumulate information actively.
We also construct a new technology that is able to record and
to search a large quantity of time series data.
In the research of social agents,
we design a communication environment for agents using a 3D virtual space.
Within a virtual meeting space,
we examine the effects of the agent's utterance and behaviors in the society,
and evaluate the agent's social roles.
The research of media adaptation bridges the gap
between information utilized by the social agent
and the information accumulated through PII.
It examines the relations between various media expressions
in a city and human's interpretations.
Then, the technology transfers the accumulated information
in accordance with the user's knowledge and sensitivity.
</P>

<P align=justify> The result of these fundamental researches is applied to
<SPAN STYLE="color: red">security, learning about the natural environment
by experience, crisis management</SPAN>, and so on.
The field experiments are developed on the stage of real cities,
which includes Kyoto.

<h3>Organizations</h3>

      <p align=justify>The <SPAN STYLE="color: red">Universal Design of Digital 
        City</SPAN> is a five-year project established in July 2000 by our project 
        director Toru Ishida, under the Core Research for Evolutional Science 
        and Technology (CREST) of the Japan Science and Technology Corporation 
        (JST). This project is promoted by <SPAN STYLE="color: red">JST Digital 
        City Research Center</SPAN> located in center Kyoto, collaborating primarily 
        with the Department of Social Informaticsat Kyoto University, Dept. Adaptive 
        Machine Systems at Osaka University, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, 
        Advanced Software Technology &amp; Mechatronics Research Institute of 
        Kyoto (ASTEM), and Advanved Telecommunications Research International 
        (ATRI). The domestic cooperation also includes the Department of Architecture 
        at Kyoto University and the Digital City Kyoto Experiment Forum. The international 
        cooperation is underway with Stanford University, California University, 
        Paris 6 University and Shanghai JiaoTong University. <a href="organization031203.gif">(Main
