<p><b>Adashino-Nenbutsuji Temple</b></p>
<p>The priest Kukai (Kobo Daishi, 774-835) built this temple for the interment 
  of unclaimed deceased. It received its present name several hundred years later, 
  after the priest Honen turned it into a training temple. The main hall was rebuilt 
  in 1712. Eight thousand stone Buddhas and stone mounds are enshrined within 
  the grounds. These are the now nameless gravestones of (usually higher-class) 
  people who died in the Adashino area, from the Heian to Edo periods. Each year 
  on August 23 and 24, thousands of candles are offered to the stone Buddhas in 
  a profound memorial service (sento-kuyo) for the deceased. The temple is part 
  of the Jodo sect. (Reservations are necessary during sento-kuyo: limited to 
  2,000 people per day.) Constructed during the Heian period (794-1183).</p>

<p><b>Tenryuji Temple(World Heritage)</b></p>
<p>Main temple of the Rinzai sect, Tenryuji School. Opened in 1339. At the time, 
  this was the greatest of five main temples in Kyoto. Visited repeatedly by fire, 
  little of the temple's grandeur at the time of foundation remains today. All 
  of the present structures are late-19th or early-20th century. The abbot's quarters 
  contain a statue (Important Cultural Property) of the Buddha who founded the 
  faith, dating from the Heian period (794-1185). There is also an image of Nikko 
  Hensho Bodhisattva (All-Illuminating Sunlight). The garden retains its original 
  design. It is a Historic Site and Place of Scenic Beauty, that makes use of 
  the scenery of Arashiyama and Kameyama (mountains). Registered as part of the 
  World Cultural Heritage in December 1994. </p>

<p><b> Togetsukyo Bridge</b></p>
<p>The symbol of Arashiyama is the "bridge that leads to the moon", the famed 
  wooden Togetsu Bridge spanning the Katsura River. The river itself is the site 
  of two wonderful festivals, both harking back to the days when the Imperial 
  family visited. Mifune Matsuri, held on the third Sunday in May, recreates spectacular 
  scenes of these visits with a boat festival replete with participants in Heian 
  period costumes. Momiji Matsuri on the second Sunday in November is a celebration 
  of the blazing autumnal tints for which Arashiyama is famous. This festival 
  brings to life the Heian times when the Emperor and his court visited Arashiyama 
  to enjoy the Momiji (maple) leaves. Beautifully-decorated boats float along 
  the river; on them, participants clad in ancient costumes perform music, dances, 
  poetry readings, and Noh drama, recalling similar times several centuries ago.</p>
