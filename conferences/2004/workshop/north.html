<p>What is Yuba? </p>
<p>Yuba, like tofu, is a food whose flavor is determined by the soybeans, the 
  water, and the technique of the producer. The process for making yuba is identical 
  to that for tofu from the boiling of the soybeans to the production of soy milk. 
  After that, the soy milk is heated and the thin film that forms on the top is 
  removed using thin rods made of bamboo. This thin film is called nama-yuba, 
  or fresh yuba. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of all the yuba produced in Japan 
  comes from Kyoto. The three key aspects of good yuba are said to be the color, 
  luster, and taste, and the key to all three is, of course, the water used. To 
  preserve the texture and flavor that have been prized since ancient times, well 
  water of consistent quality and temperature are used. Some producers have switched 
  to tap water, but it is said that even they use well water for the critical 
  steps of washing and soaking the soybeans. It is no exaggeration that excellent 
  water is essential to the production of the best yuba. Let's try Yuba!! </p>

<p><b>Ryoanji temple</b> </p>
<p>Origin: The Temple was founded in 1450 under the patronage of Hosokawa Katsumoto, 
  a top-ranking war load, who was offered the premises by the Tokudaiji family. 
</p>
<p>Features: The Temple is well-known for its rock garden, surrounded by earthen 
  walls in three directions and faced with the corridor of the Hojo building. 
  In the rectangular space measuring 30 m from east to west and 10 m from north 
  to south, 15 rocks of various sizes are arranged on white sand in five groups, 
  each comprising five, two, three, two, and three rocks. The most popular explanation 
  of this garden is that the rocks represent a mother tiger and her cubs, swimming 
  in the river of the white sand toward a fearful dragon.</p>

<p><b>Rokuonji temple (Kinkaku) </b></p>
<p>Origin: Originally a villa of the Saionji family on the hills of Kitayama, 
  but offered to the third Shogun of the Ashikaga Shogunate, Yoshimitsu Ashikaga 
  in 1397. After his death, the villa was converted into Rokuonji Temple. </p>
<p>Features: The Temple is known as an epitome of Kitayama Culture. The Golden 
  Pavilion, a gilded three-storied reliquary hall, is situated at the margin of 
  a large pond named Kyokochi Pond. It is typical architecture of the Muromachi 
  Period (1333 - 1573) .</p>
