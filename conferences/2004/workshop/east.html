<p><b>Kiyomizu temple</b></p>
<p>According to legend, Priest Enchin built his hermitage and a small chapel here 
  in 778 A.D. With support from General Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, the Temple was 
  erected in 798. Many of the present buildings were reconstructed between 1631 
  and 1633 by order of Shogun Iemitsu Tokugawa.</p>

<p> Kodai-ji Temple, formally known as Kodaiseiju Zenji, is located I the Higashiyama 
  mountains of eastern Kyoto just south of Yasaka Shrine. It was established in 
  1605 by the noblewoman Kita no Mandokoro in memory of her late husband, Shogun 
  Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-98) Kodai-ji's construction was extensively financed 
  by Tokugawa Ieyasu, Hideyoshi's chief vassal and later Shogun of Japan; the 
  result was a temple renowned for its beautiful design and exquisite craftsmanship. 
  In 1624 SankoJoeki, Abbot of kennin-ji was appointed founding priest, and Kodai-ji 
  has remained one of Kennin-ji7s largest and most important sub-temple s ever 
  since. Kodai-ji was ravaged by a series of fired after 1789, and all that survive 
  of its original buildings are the Otama-ya, Kaisando, Kangetsu-dai, kasa-tei, 
  and Shigure-tei. Fortunately these remain in an excellent state of preservation, 
  and have all been designated "important Cultural properties " by the Japanese 
  Government. Kita no Mandokoro (known more familiarily as "Nene") was awarded 
  the highest rank of nobility by Emperor GoYozei in 1588, and in 1603 was accorded 
  the honorary name Kodai-in; It is from the latter that Kodai-ji's name derives. 
  Following the custom among noble ladies of her time, she became a Buddhist nun 
  after the death of her husband and adopted the religious name Kogetsuni, She 
  died at the age of 76 on September 6, 1624. Origin: Originally a villa of the 
  Saionji family on the hills of Kitayama, but offered to the third Shogun of 
  the Ashikaga Shogunate, Yoshimitsu Ashikaga in 1397. After his death, the villa 
  was converted into Rokuonji Temple. </p>

<p><b>Yasaka Shrine</b></p>
<p>The Yasaka Shrine, known familiarly as "Gion-san," is revered as a bastion 
  of protection against evil. The vivid red entrance visible from some distance 
  is the Nishi-Sakura (West Cherry) Gate. In contrast, the sober main shrine presents 
  a calmer mien. This temple is often visited by maiko (aspiring geisha dancers). 
  Here is also famous as the center of the annual Gion Matsuri one of Japan's 
  Three Great Festivals. </p>
