For the environmental study in the field, we developed the learning support system. The equipment using wireless LAN, PDA and GPS was installed in a test site at the Field Scientific Research Center of Kyoto University. We conducted an experiment with the examinee including both young and old people. The evaluation to the education was high in this experiment, and the needs to the system could be confirmed. So, we tested to apply this application system to the education field at Kyoto municipal Inari elementary school. The system was improved for the elementary school children on the basis of the stand-alone edition, which did not utilize wireless LAN, and the improved system was used for the learning of the activity for "Period for Integrated Study" in the outside school. As the result, the school children had no problem for using the PDA for learning activities. Also, it was proven that educational effect and social acceptance were higher than we expected. Adding new functions to help preparing for teaching materials and to support teachers, we improve the system for many peopleÅfs usage. In this talk, I report practical activities at the Inari elementary school.
