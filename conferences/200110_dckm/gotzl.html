TeleCities is a network of about 120 European cities, including metropoles, small and medium-sized cities. The network co-operates Europe-wide on issues relating to the Information Society and is chaired by the City of Vienna; key business partners are joined as associate members. The TeleCities profile is based on a combination of networking activities, on research and high-level strategic work which targets on the definition of Information Society initiatives, and resulting policies of European cities. 
<br>
A short outlook of a city on its way towards a "New Digital City" is given using the City of Vienna as an example, presenting its strategic objectives, the state of the art of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and some policy related projects.
<br>
Finally, the interdependencies between New Digital Cities and a New TechnologiesÂ´ Network are demonstrated by giving a short decription of the TeleCities network and its actual projects.
