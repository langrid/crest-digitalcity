Cities are providing the physical environment for an increasing number of the world's citizens.  They are also becoming the locus for a variety of "virtual", networked digitally-based economic, political, and cultural activities and digital cities, the focus of this meeting, represent a new manifestation of this phenomenon.  Digital cities, like their physical analogies, "real" cities, are only so much infrastructure unless animated with human social presence.  My talk will focus on this social presence, particularly the type of social presence typified by the idea of "citizen," for it is primarily through the work of this social entity that social problems get addressed and social "progress" is furthered.  I will explore in my talk the characteristics of "citizens" as distinguished from other social entities and how digital city technology, policy, and use can support or undermine citizen activity and effects.
